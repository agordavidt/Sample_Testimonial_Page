                    <p>The reaseon i joined ALX was to update my skills in the current technology, but i have gotten much more out of it.  most of
                        the skills nd technologies taht i have learned are up to date with the current working environment of <full-time>jobs.  
                            I appreciate the efforts adn dedication put in by the ALX team and everyone involved.

                    <p>The ALX SE program has been intensive, packed, and eye-opening.  the learning model employed
                        is the best i've experienced.  It has taught me how to learn anything under the sun.  The progression
                        of the complexity of teh content is well-paced, yet challenging enough to keep you on your toes throughout 
                        the programme.  I would absolutely recommend the programme to anyone who is looking to statr their career in 
                        software development.

                    <p>ALX is the best program I have ever been part of. Today I am not scared of learning new technologies on demand
                        due to the rigorous course we had at ALX.  I can easily pick up a new language or framework and be decent enoughin a very short
                        span.  The program is intensive - don't doubt this - but if you do persevere, it's going to be the best learningexperience 
                        you'll ever have.

                    <p>I joined the ALX SE program not knowing what exactly to expect.  Never before have I experienced learning
                        without a teacher and so I waas very eager to see how this would work One day into the onboardingand everyoneis excited.
                        I got to meet new pals from all over the continent, some with programming experience and others without.
                        This demystified the myth that everyone at the ALX SE programme knows how to code. </p>
